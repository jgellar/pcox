Description: This package fits Cox regression models with penalized
    model terms. It is essentially an interface between a number of
    widely used R packages. Covariate terms are modeled using either
    mgcv (for scalar predictors), or a combination of mgcv and refund
    (for functional predictors). Models are fit using either the survival
    or coxme packages, depending on the fitting method.
